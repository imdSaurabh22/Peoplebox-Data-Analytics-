# Approach:
#Examine Input Data:Started by loading and reviewing the input CSV to understand its structure and the types of data it contained.

#Data Transformation:Converted date strings to datetime objects for accurate processing.Implemented a function to generate historical records for each employee based on changes in compensation, performance reviews, and engagement scores. Each change leads to a new historical record with specific effective and end dates.Derived 'Effective Date' and 'End Date' for each historical record. For records associated with changes (compensation, review, engagement), the effective date is the date of change, and the end date is set to one day before the next effective date. For the most recent record, the end date is a far-future date (2100-01-01) to indicate ongoing validity.Ensured that for periods without explicit changes, values from the most recent past record were inherited.Generate Output CSV: Created a CSV file formatted for historical analysis with structured historical data.

#Assumptions:The input data's compensation, review, and engagement change dates are accurate and in the correct format.If an employee has no recorded change for a category (e.g., no subsequent review scores), the initial values are considered valid until the end of their recorded timeline or their exit from the organization.In cases where specific dates for changes were missing, those changes were not included in the historical records.This methodology ensures a comprehensive transformation of the columnar input data into a row-based historical versioning system, suitable for detailed time-based analysis and reporting within a data warehouse environment.
